PyFibre is an open source image analysis toolkit for fibrous tissue that can be run either in a terminal or GUI.
It is designed to make the quantification of fibrous tissue automated, standardised and efficient whilst remaining as
transparent as possible for non-technical users.

Full documentation can be found at the `ReadTheDocs <https://pyfibre-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ page

Installation
------------

PyFibre is deployed using Enthought Deployment Manager, `EDM <https://www.enthought.com/product/enthought-deployment-manager/>`_.
Please download and install the latest version prior to continuing further.

Once installed, simply create a "bootstrap" environment using the command line::

    edm install -e bootstrap --version 3.6 -y click setuptools
    edm shell -e bootstrap

To begin with, either clone or download the latest release of PyFibre (currently 2.0.1) and change working
directory into the repository::

    git clone --branch '2.0.1' --depth 1 https://github.com/franklongford/PyFibre.git
    cd PyFibre

Then build the deployment ``pyfibre-py36`` environment using the following command::

    python -m ci build-env

Afterwards, install a package egg with all binaries using::

    python -m ci install

This will install all required libraries and create the local ``PyFibre`` and ``PyFibre_GUI`` entry points inside the
deployment environment. To make sure the installation has been successful, please enter the deployment environment
and run the integration test provided::

    python -m ci shell
    PyFibre --test

Further documentation on both command line and GUI programs can be found on the relevant
`ReadTheDocs pages <https://pyfibre-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyfibre_apps.html>`_.
